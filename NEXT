What if we receive the same object or addr message more than once?
MessageResponder TODOs - version checks
Sending addr and object messages on to peers?
Integrate POW
Filter messages that do not have an adequate POW
More tests for read / write -- all the object types / version
read.rs TODO - check all payload has been read
Clean up ParseError enum
Communicate messages from the connection to the wider bm_client
 - what does the wider bm_client do with them?
 API for BMClient? Create addresses, send messages (sync vs async?), event for message receipt, configure IP addresses/ports
Test encrypted messages for decryptability
Cope better with failing to connect to enough peers in peer.rs loop

Message logic:

Got         Do
=======     =============================
version     Send verack
verack      Send addr * 1 + inv * n
inv         Send (appropriate) getdata
getdata     Send (appropriate) object * n
addr        Send addr to other nodes???
object      Send to other nodes???





TODO:
